    """
    Canonical lifecycle orchestration for DisSModel executors.

    Runs validate → load → run → save in order, times each phase
    independently, and populates record.metrics with the results.

    Used by both the CLI runner and the platform job_runner to ensure
    behavioural parity without code duplication.

    Parameters
    ----------
    executor:
        An instantiated ModelExecutor subclass.
    record:
        The ExperimentRecord for this job. May be mutated in-place by
        load() (e.g. source.checksum) and save() (output_path, status).

    Returns
    -------
    record:
        The completed ExperimentRecord with status, output_path, and
        metrics populated.
    timings:
        Dict with individual phase times and total:
        time_validate_sec, time_load_sec, time_run_sec,
        time_save_sec, time_total_sec.
